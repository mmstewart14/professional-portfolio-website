          <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
          <p>This project was for a team developing and testing unmanned, autonomous drones. The team was relying almost exclusively on a command-line interface to push and pull data from each vehicle.
            This was a huge bottleneck for the team's operations, and eventually customers of the finished vehicles would need to interact with their vehicles in a similar manner, and would
             not be expected to use the command-line. Some sort of GUI was needed in order to speed up development and be appealing to future customers.</p>
          <h4 class="disclaimer">DISCLAIMER: The data presented in the images below is fake, for the sake of confidentiality. </h4>
          <h3>DESIGN</h3>
          <p>The two main functions the tool needed to serve were to help pilots identify which flight log they are looking for updating vehicle flight parameters. Three months of development and continual user input led to the following Python Flask hosted web application.</p>
          <div class="tool-image">
            <img src="images/ge3.png">
          </div>
          <p class="image-caption">Login Page</p>
          <p>The home page featured a concise dashboard, which contained four quick links to the most common use cases; The last flown flight log was avaliable for download, next to links to the three different vehicle configuration pages.</p>
          <div class="tool-image">
            <img src="images/ge5.png">
          </div>
          <p class="image-caption">Home Page</p>
          <p>The flight log management page needed to help users identify which flight logs were important to them. Each flight controller saves up to 100 different logs at a time, so helping the user identify which they are looking for was important.
          The flight metadata displayed was chosen for its ability to help the user identify which log they want. Logs were sorted by recency, and the most recent flight log which had an armed-time was automatically highlighted and selected upon page load.
          This log was also marked with the "recent" icon to the right of the table.</p>
          <p>Each flight log (.ulg) file had some associated .txt files, these were also provided for download in this table. They are automatically hidden but toggle-able by the arrow button next to each flight log, as they were needed uncommonly. If a flight log failed to have a timestamp, it was placed at the end of the
          list and identified by a red exclamation point icon to the right of the table. If any logs on the flight controller were missing timestamps, an alert would pop-up letting the user know which logs were bad and that they were at the end of the list.</p>
          <div class="tool-image">
            <img src="images/ge4.png">
          </div>
          <p class="image-caption">Flight Log Management Page</p>
          <p>The second main functionality was updating vehicle flight parameters. The configuration home page was the user's home base for importing and exporting the flight paramters. Importing flight parameters would
          fill in the values on the other tabs where they could then make changes from the GUI. Users had the option to either import flight parameters from an external configuration file or by reading the current configuration off of the flight computer. Unless a file
          was input by the user, hitting the read button would read the current configuration from the flight computer. A user could also export the flight parameters once they had made their desired changes. The user would select whether they'd like to export the
          configuration directly to the flight controller (M100), to a file, or both.</p>
          <div class="tool-image">
            <img src="images/ge2.png">
          </div>
          <p class="image-caption">Configuration Home Page</p>
          <p>The final four images are the configuration tabs where users could make changes to the flight parameters imported. All values were editable via select boxes or text entry, whichever was applicable. Many of the pages were dense with numbers and data, so I used colors to help users better comprehend.</p>
          <div class="tool-image">
            <img src="images/ge1.png">
          </div>
          <p class="image-caption">Configuration Source Select Tab</p>
          <p>The last three configuration tabs are not fully completed. The hex values need to be converted to user-readable numbers and the visual appeal and user experience need improvement. The data needs to be better arranged and formatted for comprehension in a way that helps users not mix values across lines.</p>

          <h3>BACK-END</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Read log files and flight parameters from flight controller.</li>
            <li>Served files and data to the front-end using Python's Flask.</li>
            <li>Handled sending updated parameters from JavaScript, to Python, back to the flight controller.</li>
